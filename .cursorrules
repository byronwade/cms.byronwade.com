# Purpose:
# This repository is dedicated to creating a CMS frontend using Next.js with NO backend functionality.
# The system is designed with a server-first approach to leverage the performance and scalability of Next.js Server Components.
# All data interactions are strictly handled through `actions` folder files (e.g., `getCustomers`, `getInvoices`) to simulate backend functionality.
# The project mimics the modular, user-friendly design and functionality of Payload 3.0 and WordPress, focusing entirely on frontend features.

# Repository Overview:
# - The application is built with server-first components to optimize performance.
# - All data is simulated or fetched through static or pre-defined functions in the `actions` folder.
# - Backend logic, API calls, and database integrations are strictly prohibited.

# Key Principles:
- Server Components are the default for all layouts, pages, and reusable components unless client-side interactivity is required.
- Client Components should only be used for components requiring interactivity, such as forms, dropdowns, or modals.
- Data flow is managed entirely by `actions` files to simulate backend interactions without true backend functionality.

# Folder Rules:

app/:
  description: >
    The primary directory for routing, layouts, and rendering all components.
    This directory follows a server-first approach, with Server Components used by default.
    Client Components are only used where necessary for interactivity.
    Example usage:
      - `app/customers/page.tsx` uses `getCustomers` from `actions/getCustomers.js` to render a static list of customers via a Server Component.

    Key rules:
      - Ensure all components prioritize Server Components unless interactivity is required.
      - Data fetching within `app/` must exclusively use `actions` functions.

actions/:
  description: >
    The sole location for all simulated data-handling logic.
    Contains functions like `getCustomers` and `getInvoices` to fetch or transform data.
    These functions are used across the application to provide a centralized data layer.
    Example structure:
      - `actions/getCustomers.js`: Returns a list of customers.
      - `actions/getInvoices.js`: Simulates fetching invoices for display.

    Key rules:
      - No external API calls or true backend operations are allowed.
      - All data transformations or filtering logic must be performed here.

components/:
  description: >
    Contains modular and reusable React components.
    Server Components should be used by default.
    Client Components are reserved for interactivity such as forms, buttons, or dropdown menus.
    Example:
      - A `CustomerList` component renders customer data fetched by `getCustomers()` as a Server Component.

    Key rules:
      - Components should prioritize Server Components unless interactivity requires a Client Component.
      - All components must use data provided by `actions` functions.

styles/:
  description: >
    Contains global and TailwindCSS-specific styles.
    TailwindCSS must be used exclusively for styling components and layouts.

# Design Mimicry Guidelines:
- The repository is inspired by Payload 3.0 and WordPress for modularity and reusability.
- Use a block-based structure for layouts and templates.
- Ensure components are dynamically rendered with a focus on user-friendly, clean UI/UX.

# Prohibitions and Restrictions:
- Backend functionality such as database queries, API endpoints, or persistent storage is strictly forbidden.
- Do not introduce placeholder backend logic in `actions` or components.

# Server-First Guidelines:
- Use Server Components wherever possible for layouts, rendering, and data-fetching components.
- Client Components are only permitted for interactive UI elements or where server-side rendering is infeasible.
- Ensure Server Components rely on static data from `actions` files for rendering.

# Code Guidelines:
- Adhere to DRY principles (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
- Use descriptive variable and function names for clarity and maintainability.
- Implement accessibility features (e.g., aria-labels, tabindex) for compliance with best practices.
- Use TailwindCSS exclusively for styling; avoid inline or external CSS files unless absolutely necessary.

# Testing:
- Verify that Server Components render correctly using data from `actions` functions.
- Test for modularity, ensuring reusable components across different parts of the application.
- Ensure no backend-related bugs are introduced.

# Example Scenario:
- Rendering a customer list:
  - Use the `getCustomers` function from `actions/getCustomers.js` to fetch the data.
  - Pass the data to a Server Component, such as `CustomerList`, for rendering in the `app` directory.

# Notes:
- This repository is designed as a server-first, frontend-only CMS to replicate backend-like behavior using simulated data.
- All components, layouts, and features must align with the philosophy of frontend modularity and mimic Payload 3.0 and WordPress.
